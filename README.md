# IRCTC Railway Management System

This project is a **Railway Management System** designed to simulate key functionalities of the IRCTC system. The system enables train seat bookings, checks for train availability, updates train details, and ensures role-based access for users and admins. The backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MySQL**.

  - Admin functionalities to add, update, or remove trains.
- **Seat Booking System**:
  - Real-time seat booking with race condition handling to ensure data consistency.
  - Booking history accessible to users.
- **Role-Based Access**:
  - Separate features for users and admins to maintain system integrity.
  - Admins can update seat availability, add trains, and more.
- **Error Handling and Input Validation**:
  - Comprehensive error responses for invalid inputs or actions.
  - Validation of train details and user data.
- **Database Efficiency**:
  - Optimized database schema to handle a large number of trains and bookings.
  - Referential integrity with foreign key constraints.
- **Modular Codebase**:
  - Clean and scalable code structure with a separation of concerns.
  - Use of middleware for reusable logic like authentication.

## Additional Features (New)

- **Enhanced Security**:
  - API key-based admin access for critical operations.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (Database setup)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (for API testing)

### Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following environment variables:

```bash
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=Abhi@9001
DB_NAME=irctc_db
JWT_SECRET=Abhishek
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhi96k/IRCTC_API_WORKINDIA_TASK.git
   cd IRCTC_API_WORKINDIA_TASK
   ```
2. Install all necessary dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

3. Set up your MySQL database:

- Create a MySQL database named irctc_db.
- Run the SQL scripts in database/schema.sql to create necessary tables (users, trains, bookings).

Example:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE irctc_db;
USE irctc_db;

CREATE TABLE users (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
   password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user',
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE trains (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   train_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   total_seats INT NOT NULL,
   available_seats INT NOT NULL,
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   user_id INT,
   train_id INT,
   seats INT NOT NULL,
   FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
   FOREIGN KEY (train_id) REFERENCES trains(id)
);
```

### Starting the Server

Once the setup is complete, start the server using npm:

```bash
npm start

```
